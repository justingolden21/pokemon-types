type chart
    top left cell can have icon with diagonal line top right to bottom left splitting sword and shield icon for attackers/defender types
    maybe later: quick search type on desktop, lower opacity black on rows and cols not of that type atk/def
add type line chart
use localstorage, remember settings (at least dark mode), selected types
handle url params between typechart and types (needs more bug testing)
handle pokemon forms, regionals, megas (giratina origin/altered, regional meowth, mega gyrados, etc )

reset settings btn
store pokemon id/types in localstorage, load if no url params present (load before url params are loaded)
question: if both url params and local storage are present, and url params are loaded, should those params be stored in local storage, overriding previous storage from url

maybe:
add popover titles
start using umbrella.js
make util.js
store weather in param (in addition to types/pokemon id)

future: mention pokemon with levitate ability (immune to ground) if doing mainline series
