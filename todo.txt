type chart
    top left cell can have icon with diagonal line top right to bottom left splitting sword and shield icon for attackers/defender types
    maybe later: quick search type on desktop, lower opacity black on rows and cols not of that type atk/def
add type line chart
use localstorage, remember settings (at least dark mode), selected types
handle url params between typechart and types (needs more bug testing)
handle pokemon forms, regionals, megas (giratina origin/altered, regional meowth, mega gyrados, etc )
reset settings btn

maybe:
add popover titles
start using umbrella.js
make util.js
show number of pokemon with these types
store weather in param (in addition to types/pokemon id)
